IAC Tools :

Fundamentals of Ansible and Terraform :::

	IAC Tools ::
	
		- Infra-Structure As Code.
		
		How the server provision is done?
		
		How the Configurations are done in the servers?
		
		Testing :::
		
		Test servers are required only during the testing phase. 
		
		Infra-Structure Team == using some shell scripts or in-house tools 
		
	IAC Tools ::
	
		Server Provisioning 		--> Terraform is used for server provisioning/Creations
		
		Configuration Management 	--> Ansible to configure the servers - Install/Manage the packages.
		
		
	Fundamentals of Ansible :::
	
		What is Ansible ?
		
			Ansible - Is a Configuration Management Tool - used to configure the servers - Install/Manage the packages.
		Purpose/Usecase of Ansible ?
		
		Ansible Architecture - and its components.
		
			Inventory Files
			
			Modules 
			
			ansible.cfg
			
		Working with Ansible ::
		
			- Ansible Adhoc Commands
			
					[dev_servers] --> git --version 
  
			- Ansible Playbooks  --> To ensure reusability.
			
					Install Maven --> 
			
					[build_servers]

							install git 
							install jdk
							install maven 
							
		Installation & Configuration of Ansible :::
		
			AWS ::
			
				Launch 3 VMs 
				
					1 - AC, 2 - Ansible Nodes
		
			
			Authentication? using ssh keys.
			
			userid
			auth ::

			Ansible Modules :::
			
				The modules will be pushed into the target server 
				Execute
				Upon Execute, the module will be automatically remove from target server.
				
			Ansible Playbooks : written using *.yaml scripts.
			
			yaml --> key-value 
			
			Playbooks is used to execute the series of tasks.
			Modules
				fetch 
				copy 
				
			Reusability ::::
			
				Handling Variables in Yaml files ::::
				Roles ==> used to organise, reuse and share teh ansible components.
				
			Variables :::
			
				Using Default variables using ansible facts
				
				User Defined variables :::
			
					- Hardcoded in the playbook using vars key.
					- Using External Variable files using vars_files key.
					- Using Extra values using -e by parameterizing the playbook.
					
		
			Register 
			Handlers 
			Loops 
			Roles
