			Introduction to DevOps!!!
			
				GIT,Jenkins,Build_Tools,Docker,Kubernetes,Ansible,Terraform,Prometheus&Grafana
				
				Scripting Languages : shell scripting, groovy scripting, yaml scripting --> python scripting
				
			Introduction to DevOps...!!!
			
			What is DevOps ?
			
			Software ?
			
				Application Software ::
				
				System Software ::
			
				Application - collection of programs
			
			Types of Software ?
			
				Destops Application Software 
				Web Application 
				Mobile Application
			
			Online _ Applications ::
				E_Commerce Application protals 
					www.amazon.com
					
			I want to create a E_Learning Portal ::: 
			
			SDLC - Software Development Life Cycle 
			
				Require Analysis 
				Design
				Coding/Development
				Testing
				Implementation/Production Release 
				Maintainence/Monitor
				
				Water-fall Model ::: 	Using this water fall model we can achieve this:
										It is linear in fashion
										We can go back and revise the plan/design.
										Water-fall Model cannot accommodate the new changes in mid of the project.
										If any new changes comes in, it should be considered as a new project.
						
				Require Analysis 
				Design
				Coding/Development
				Testing
				Implementation/Production Release 
				Maintainence/Monitor

					To create a E_Learning Portal ::: 	
					
					Core_Project 
						Require Analysis 				6 - 9 months to complete the product.
						Design
						Coding/Development
						Testing
						Implementation/Production Release 
						Maintainence/Monitor			
					
					Core_Project_v1 
						Require Analysis 				1-2 months to complete the product_v1.
						Design
						Coding/Development
						Testing
						Implementation/Production Release 
						Maintainence/Monitor	

			
				AGILE Methodologies :::

					Split the whole application into various Modules/Iterations :
					
						User_Registration
						User_login 
						User_Search_Courses
						User_Register_Course 
						User_Payment
						User_Track
				
					Iteration 1 : User_Registration
					
						Require Analysis 
						Design
						Coding/Development
						Testing
						Implementation/Production Release 
						Maintainence/Monitor				
				
				
					Iteration 2 : User_Login
					
						Require Analysis 
						Design
						Coding/Development
						Testing
						Implementation/Production Release 
						Maintainence/Monitor					
			
			
					Iteration 3 : New_CR
					
						Require Analysis 
						Design
						Coding/Development
						Testing
						Implementation/Production Release 
						Maintainence/Monitor	

				Using AGILE we can achieve ::
				
					Continuous Development
					Continuous Integration
					Continuous Testing
					Continuous Delivery 
					
				Using AGILE, we can achieve Continuous Delivery. But, NOT Continuous Deployment.
				
					Continuous Delivery 	--> Need Manual approval for any production release.
					
					Continuous Deployment 	--> This doesnt required any manual approval to production release.
					
					
				DevOps :::
				
					Is a Software Development Strategy, which helps to promote the collaboration between the teams like Development Teams and Operations Teams to achieve Continuous Development, Continuous Integration, Continuous Testing, Continuous Delivery, Continuous Deployment and Continuous Monitoring in an automated fashion.
					
				
					Based upon the Application Architecture:
					
						Monolith Application Architecture :::
							It is a tightly couple Application Architecture.
							
							Eg.:
								Billing System ::
								
									Create User Interface 
									Application Logic to validate the user inputs 
									Application Logic to Compute the inputs 
									Application Logic to save the trasaction to a dbase 
									Application Logic to generate the report
									
								
						Micro-Service based Application Architecture :::
							It is loosely coupled Application Architecture.
							Here the deployment is not at the application level
							It is at the service level.
							This allows to the independent development, testing and deployment of application to production.
							
							The whole application into various Modules/Iterations/micro-service :
							
							Eg.: 
								www.amazon.com :::
								
									Sign-Up			Micro-Service1 - Developer1 - Independently code, test, and deploy to production
									Sign_In
									Search 
									Add_to_Cart
									Payment
									Place_Order 
									Tracking
									
							3-tier Application Architecture
										Front_End 
										Application_logic 
										Back_End(Dbase)
										
										
						Application :: 
						
							Cloud 
							On-Premises
							Hybrid Environment ( Cloud & On-Premises)
							
				DevOps :::

				Teams ::::
		
				
					DevOps_Team :
					
						Infra-Structure Management Team
						Application Development Team 			==> java_application.
						Testing Team 							==> java_application.
						Release Management Team 
						Production Support Team
						Production Monitoring Team
						Security Team
				
				DevOps Stages ::::
				
					Continuous Development :
					
						Developer ::: Roles & Responsibilities :: Java Web Application Development 
						
						Tradional Approach:
							Code the Application
							Build - Compile the source code & Create artifacts (Binaries - *.war)
							Unit Test 
							Promote the code to higher environment - QA Testing
							Notify the Testing to pick up the application for further testing 
							
						DevOps Approach:
							Developers create the code & publish the latest src_code to GIT
							
							Using DevOps Automation:	
								Build - Compile the source code & Create artifacts (Binaries - *.war)
								Unit Test 
								Promote the code to higher environment - QA Testing
								Notify the Testing to pick up the application for further testing 
								
						Tools :
							IDEs - Eclipse based IDEs / Visual Studio Code / Visual Studio / Pycharm
							GIT 
							Jenkins 
						
					Continuous Integration :
							It is a capability of the team to continuously integrate the code for further testing without relying on other.

						
							Sign-Up			Micro-Service1 - Developer1 - Independently code, test, and deploy to production
							Sign_In
							Search 
							Add_to_Cart
							Payment
							Place_Order 
							Tracking
					
						Tools :
						
							Jenkins,Ansible,Docker,Kubernetes
					
					Continuous Testing 
							Implement continuous testing 
							
						Tools : 
							Jenkins,TestNG,Junit,Selenium
							
						
					Continuous Delivery / Continuous Deployment :
					
						Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment are used for production release.
								Continuous Delivery 	--> Need Manual approval for any production release.
								
								Continuous Deployment 	--> This doesnt required any manual approval to production release.						
						
						Tools :						
							Jenkins,Ansible,Docker,Kubernetes						
					
					Continuous Monitoring ::::
					
						Monitoring :::
						
							www.amazon.com	
							
							Infra-Structure Monitoring :::
									
										Network
										
										Traffic 
										
										CPU Utilization 
										
										Memory Utilization 
										
									80% 
						Tools : Prometheus&Grafana,Splunk, Datadog, Dynatrace, Nagios
						Jenkins									
							
							Application Monitoring :: AppDynamics
							
				

				
				Tools ::::
					
					- Open Source Tools 
							GIT,Jenkins,Build_Tools,Docker,Kubernetes,Ansible,Terraform,Prometheus&Grafana
							
					- Managed Services
					
						AWS 		DevOps Tools -> AWS Code commit, pipeline, build
						Azure 
						GCP
							
							
				Infra-Structure Team ::
				
					Provision the Infra-Structure & Configure the Servers 
					IAC Tools :
						Terraform 	- Server Provisioning 
						Ansible 	- Configuration Management
					
				
				DevOps Workflow / LifeCycle :::
				
				CI/CD Pipeline / Lifecycle :::
				
					Continuous Deployment can be achieved only using the matured level of DevOps :::
				
				Production Deployment Window ::: --> For (4 to 6 Hrs.)
				
				Appln_v1.5
				Appln_v1.6			==> New Version 
				
					Banking/Financial
					
					On_line Banking Service / Credit Transaction...........
					
						Production Testing ==> 
					
							- Try to fix that issue.
							- Rollback/Revert

					Continuous Delivery Process of Production Release.
